    "I want to validate a Monte Carlo Simulation. I have a year's worth of data from a team, counting collected stories. Knowing how many stories they complete by the end of the year, I want to estimate, each sprint, what the odds are that they will complete that number of stories by the end of the year. Basically, we're back-testing the Monte Carlo simulations."
